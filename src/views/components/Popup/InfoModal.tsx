            <WrapperInfo>
            <Ptag>The Daily Draw is a distribution of prizes EVERY DAY to the top 100 Winlambo players of the previous day!</Ptag>

            <Ptag>The Daily Draw happens at 16:00 UTC of every day.<br/>
            To see the players that qualify for tomorrow's prizes, take a look at "TODAY'S TOP 100 ACTIVE TRADERS" section above!</Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            The total prizes distributed are equal to 5% of the BUSD in the Daily Jackpot Fund.<br/>
            That means, every day, 5% of the BUSD in this <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xb61ed72a55ff87a2b731e8d247555c1ee499a56a" target="_blank" style={{border: 'none'}}>wallet</a> is distributed to Winlambo players!
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            For example, if the wallet above has 2000 BUSD in it, then the total prizes for the day equal 100 BUSD.<br/>
            The prizes are distributed as follows--
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            3 Guaranteed Prizes<br/>
            1st Place - 15% of the total prizes, e.g. 15 BUSD.<br/>
            2nd Place - 10% of the total prizes, e.g. 10 BUSD.<br/>
            3rd Place - 5% of the total prizes, e.g. 5 BUSD.
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            14 Lucky Prizes<br/>
            Any of the Top 100 Active Traders of the previous day have a chance to win up to 14 times!<br/>
            Each prize is 5% of the total prizes, e.g. 5 BUSD.
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            The top 100 players are all given tickets according to how much Winlambo they hold compared to the rest of the 100 players.<br/>
            So if Player A holds 1000 Winlambo, and the remaining 99 players hold a total of 1000 Winlambo, then Player A receives 50% of the tickets, and the remaining 99 players receive 50% of the tickets.

            <h3>Lambo Draw</h3>
            <WrapperInfo>
            <Ptag>The Lambo Draw is the reason WINLAMBO exists!</Ptag>

            <Ptag>Every time the Lambo Fund has 300,000 BUSD in it, 210,000 BUSD is given away to a lucky holder!
            All WINLAMBO holders are eligible to win!</Ptag>

            <Ptag>Here is the story on the most recent winner: <a href="https://bsctimes.com/winlambo-gives-away-its-first-lambo/" target="_blank" style={{border: 'none'}}>https://bsctimes.com/winlambo-gives-away-its-first-lambo</a></Ptag>

            <Ptag>Your tokens are your tickets! Therefore, the more tokens you hold at the time of The Lambo Draw, the more tickets you have, and the higher your chances are of winning!</Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            When you buy or receive WINLAMBO, you get tickets.<br/>
            When you sell or send WINLAMBO, you lose your tickets.
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>The lowest possible range of Lambo tickets in the system is 100,000,001, and the highest range is 999,999,999.</Ptag>
            <Ptag>Your ticket numbers can be seen by connecting your wallet at the top of this page!</Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            If you are the winner of The Lambo Draw, you MUST NOT buy, sell or transfer WINLAMBO tokens until you have received your winnings.<br/>
            This is because the team needs to verify that you're the winner, and transferring tokens changes your tickets.
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            The winner has 3 days to claim their winnings. To claim, the winner must send 0.0001 BNB to the Lambo Fund so that we know that the winner has access to their wallet. 
            The Lambo Fund can be seen at <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x8dA5e332A088779be241C79B8ffe53003E4529A2" target="_blank" style={{border: 'none'}}>https://bscscan.com/address/0x8dA5e332A088779be241C79B8ffe53003E4529A2</a>
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>Once the winner has claimed their winnings, they will receive 210,000 BEP-20 BUSD from the Lambo Fund.</Ptag>
            <Ptag>
            Pro tip: In order to incorporate the 2% reflection from other peopleâ€™s transactions into your tickets, send or receive 1 WINLAMBO token to yourself a few minutes before the Jackpot happens!
            </Ptag>
            <Ptag>Best of luck to all our holders during The Lambo Draw!</Ptag>
